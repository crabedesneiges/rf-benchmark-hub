## [Unreleased]

### Fixed — CLDNN chance-collapse root-caused (CLDNN-scoped fix: per-sample input normalization)

- **Root cause (multi-agent workflow → per-epoch cluster diagnostic).** The earlier grad-clip "fix"
  only masked the NaN *symptom*; CLDNN still pinned at chance (0.0909). The real cause is a
  **CLDNN-specific input-conditioning fragility**: RadioML 2016.10a is ~unit-average-power, so raw
  per-sample IQ is tiny (RMS ~1e-2), and CLDNN has **no input normalization and no BatchNorm** —
  that near-zero-scale signal, fed through the conv front end AND (via the raw-waveform skip)
  straight into the 3-layer stacked LSTM, lets the deep recurrence collapse to a constant-class
  output **for some weight-init draws**. The diagnostic showed the un-normalized model **collapsed
  on the board's unseeded init yet learns on seed 42** — a fragility, not a deterministic bug.
  ResNet hit the *identical* exact-1/11 collapse earlier and was cured by exactly this normalization.
- **Fix — one change inside `rfbench/models/baselines/cldnn.py`** (cannot touch MCLDNN/ResNet;
  `training.py` recipe byte-for-byte unchanged): **per-sample unit-variance input normalization**
  (`_unit_variance_normalize`, the same transform `resnet_amc` uses) at the top of
  `CLDNNNet._conv_sequence`, before the conv **and** the raw skip, so both see ~unit-scale IQ. With
  a real input scale the LSTM cannot ignore the (tiny) input, so it learns robustly regardless of
  the init draw. Gated by `input_norm` (default **True**) → `MODELS.get("cldnn")()` builds the fixed
  model with no CLI change; `input_norm=False` reproduces the fragile config for ablation.
- **Diagnostic-driven (this is why we ran the short job first).** The per-epoch diagnostic
  (`slurm/diagnose_cldnn.py`, job 86194, seed 42, 20 ep) compared four variants and **overturned
  the workflow's proposed second half**: `broken` 0.5659 · **`norm` 0.5848** · `init` (forget-bias-1
  + orthogonal LSTM re-init, no norm) **0.0909 — collapsed** · `norm_init` 0.5848. So normalization
  is **necessary and sufficient**, and the LSTM re-init is **inert with norm and actively harmful
  without it** (the deep LSTM ignores the tiny input) — it was therefore **dropped** from the model.
  It logs, per epoch, val-accuracy · LR · pre-clip grad-norm · clip-bite · prediction entropy /
  top-class fraction · conv & LSTM activation std; a `--seed` sweep confirms `norm` is init-robust
  before the 150-epoch retrain (`slurm/retrain_cldnn_arm.sh`).
- **Follow-up flagged (not in this fix):** `training.py` val-accuracy checkpoint selection with
  `best_acc=-1.0` silently reports the untrained epoch-0 snapshot for a run that never beats chance —
  a robustness gap (not the CLDNN root cause) worth hardening separately.
- **Seed-robustness confirmed** before the long retrain (job 86196, 4 seeds × 12 ep): `norm` scores
  0.5631 / 0.5650 / 0.5690 / 0.5665 — tight and always ≫ 0.50 — while un-normalized `broken` swings
  0.4978–0.5400 and **collapses to 0.1275 on seed 123**, directly demonstrating the init fragility
  the normalization removes.
- **Board updated:** CLDNN re-trained from scratch (RadioML 2016.10a, seed 42, 150 epochs, final
  recipe) → **accuracy_overall 0.5805** (`leaderboard/results/amc/cldnn.json`, schema-valid +
  PR-ready; 440 907 params, 1× GB200), the first honest figure for the paper-faithful 3-LSTM+skip
  CLDNN under the final recipe (the prior 0.5876 was a superseded 2-LSTM/no-skip arch). MCLDNN
  (0.6171) / ResNet (0.5661) untouched. Tests (`tests/test_cldnn.py`: normalization applied on the
  default path, raw-skip identity under `input_norm=False`) + `ruff`/`black`/`mypy` green.

### Added — educational content on the leaderboard site (data-driven)

- **Enriched task manifest** (`leaderboard/tasks.json`): each task now merges optional
  educational fields alongside the existing `id/title/status/priority/blurb` —
  `description` (what/why), a `dataset` card object (`name`, `source`, `n_classes`,
  `modality`, `real_or_synthetic`, `conditions`, `license`, `split`), a `primary_metric`
  (`{name, definition}`) and a `secondary_metrics` list. All new fields are optional; the
  `$comment` documents the shape.
- **Per-task explanatory header** (`leaderboard/site/generate.py`): every task page — full
  leaderboard AND minimal WIP/planned page — is topped by a manifest-driven header
  (`_render_task_header`): the description, a compact dataset card and the primary +
  secondary metric definitions. Purely additive and generic (`DeclaredTask` extended with
  the optional fields, parsed in `load_manifest` via `_parse_metric_def`/`_parse_dataset`);
  a task missing any piece simply omits it, and an undeclared-but-has-results task renders
  no header — the existing generic per-metric/per-regime/WIP rendering is untouched.
- **Guide page** (`guide.html`, `render_guide`): renders the shared educational content
  (embedded `_GUIDE` constant) — a "What is I/Q?" section, the four evaluation regimes,
  verified-vs-self_reported, the data policy, the split policy, and a metrics glossary
  (name + definition + an up/down arrow for higher/lower-is-better). Linked as a **Guide**
  nav chip on every page (nav-chip mechanism extended; chip goes active on the Guide page).
- **Tests** (`tests/test_site.py`): asserts the Guide page is written with the I/Q section +
  metrics glossary (both arrow directions), a task page carries its dataset card + metric
  definitions above the tables, WIP pages still render the header, the header is omitted for
  undeclared tasks, and the manifest's educational fields load (and stay optional). All 16+
  existing site tests kept passing. `ruff`/`black --line-length 100`/`mypy` clean.

### Added — `protocol_tech_id` task (WiFi 802.11 standard recognition, P2)

- **New downstream task** `protocol_tech_id`: single-label closed-set classification of a raw-IQ
  window into 4 IEEE 802.11 standards (`802.11b`, `802.11g`, `802.11n`, `802.11ax`). Mirrors the
  AMC / interference_id skeleton exactly. `rfbench/tasks/protocol_tech_id/`
  (`ProtocolTechIdTask` registered `protocol_tech_id`), primary `accuracy_overall` + `macro_f1`
  (single-label classification metrics reused from AMC; the primary metric mirrors AMC's minus the
  SNR `eval_conditions` so `eval.conditions` stays clean). `configs/task/protocol_tech_id.yaml`.
  Distinct from `amc`: recognises the WiFi *standard*, not the modulation scheme.
- **Dataset** `tprime_wifi4` (split id base `proto-tprime-wifi4-8010-seed42-v1`): T-PRIME OTA WiFi
  set (Genesys Lab / Northeastern; paper arXiv:2401.04837, code github.com/genesys-neu/t-prime,
  data on Northeastern DRS collection `neu:h989s847q`) — **real over-the-air** raw interleaved-IQ
  `.bin` captures, 4 classes, ~66 GB, 20 MHz. No official split ships in the repo → 80/10/10
  stratified by class, seed 42. `rfbench/data/prepare/protocol.py` +
  `rfbench/data/download/protocol_tprime.py` (heavy deps lazy, `$RFBENCH_CACHE`, split indices +
  checksums only — never raw IQ, D3). **License**: DRS is openly downloadable but the dataset's
  redistribution terms are **unstated** (flagged in the dataset card). **Cluster-confirm TODOs**:
  the direct DRS artifact URL (item-specific, pass `source_url=`) and the exact `.bin` dtype /
  window tiling.
- **Baseline** `tprime` (`rfbench/models/baselines/tprime.py`): the T-PRIME transformer over raw
  interleaved IQ with NO learned input embedding — a `(2, N)` window sliced into `M` tokens of
  `(2, S)`, each flattened to a `1×2S` token fed to a 2-layer transformer encoder. Default **SM**
  (`M=24`, `S=64`, `N=1536`, ~1.6M params); **LG** (`M=64`, `S=128`, `N=8192`, ~6.8M) via
  `variant="LG"` / `model.variant=LG`. Registered + CLI-reachable
  (`--task protocol_tech_id --model tprime`). Cites T-PRIME (arXiv:2401.04837).
- **FROZEN-CONTRACT edit (reviewed)**: added `"protocol_tech_id"` to the `task.name` enum in
  BOTH `schemas/result.schema.json` and `schemas/submission.schema.json` (+ the `result_path`
  pattern), mirrored in `rfbench/core/types.py` `TaskName`. `schema_version` stays `1.0.0`; the
  new task owns `version: v1`.
- **Docs/site/CLI**: `docs/EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md` §protocol_tech_id (normative), `TASK_TITLES`
  /`TASK_ORDER` in the site generator, CLI enum tables + prepare/download dispatch + `tprime`
  model module.
- **Tests**: `tests/test_task_protocol_tech_id.py` (dep-free metric/registry/end-to-end +
  numpy-guarded index-alignment regression) and `tests/test_tprime.py` (torch-gated). Both
  skip cleanly in the dep-free venv.

### Added — `interference_id` task (GNSS jamming classification, P2)

- **New downstream task** `interference_id`: single-label closed-set classification of a raw-IQ
  window into 6 GNSS-jamming classes (`DME`, `narrowband`, `single_am`, `single_chirp`,
  `single_fm`, `no_jamming`). Mirrors the AMC skeleton exactly. `rfbench/tasks/interference_id/`
  (`InterferenceIdTask` registered `interference_id`), primary `accuracy_overall` + `macro_f1`
  (single-label classification metrics reused from AMC; the primary metric mirrors AMC's minus the
  SNR `eval_conditions` so `eval.conditions` stays clean). `configs/task/interference_id.yaml`.
- **Dataset** `interf_gnss6` (split id base `interf-gnss6-8010-seed42-v1`): Swinney & Woods 2021
  raw-IQ set (Zenodo record 4629685, DOI 10.5281/zenodo.4629685, CC-BY-4.0,
  `Raw_IQ_Dataset.zip` ~1.9 GB, no login). 80/10/10 stratified by class, seed 42.
  `rfbench/data/prepare/interference.py` + `rfbench/data/download/interference_gnss.py` (heavy deps
  lazy, `$RFBENCH_CACHE`, split indices + checksums only — never raw data, D3). **Honesty**: the
  signals are MATLAB-synthesised but distributed as a downloadable raw-IQ archive, so this is a
  public-download dataset, not a generation-only blocker.
- **Baseline** `interf_cnn` (`rfbench/models/baselines/interf_cnn.py`): compact 1-D IQ CNN over
  `(2, L)` windows (conv-BN-ReLU blocks + global pool + linear head), registered + CLI-reachable
  (`--task interference_id --model interf_cnn`). Cites Morales-Ferre et al. 2019 and
  Swinney & Woods 2021 as literature SOTA.
- **FROZEN-CONTRACT edit (reviewed)**: added `"interference_id"` to the `task.name` enum in
  BOTH `schemas/result.schema.json` and `schemas/submission.schema.json` (+ the `result_path`
  pattern), mirrored in `rfbench/core/types.py` `TaskName`. `schema_version` stays `1.0.0`; the
  new task owns `version: v1`.
- **Docs/site/CLI**: `docs/EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md` §interference_id (normative), `TASK_TITLES`
  /`TASK_ORDER` in the site generator, CLI enum tables + prepare/download dispatch.
- **Tests**: `tests/test_task_interference_id.py` (dep-free metric/registry/end-to-end +
  numpy-guarded index-alignment regression) and `tests/test_interf_cnn.py` (torch-gated). Both
  skip cleanly in the dep-free venv.

### Changed — AMC board updated with the final-recipe retrain (MCLDNN, ResNet)

- Re-trained from scratch (RadioML 2016.10a, seed 42, 150 epochs) under the fixed recipe
  (val-accuracy best-checkpoint + gradient clipping + paper-exact archs): **MCLDNN 0.6008 → 0.6171**
  and **ResNet 0.5606 → 0.5661**. Both now exceed their prior board scores.
- **~~KNOWN ISSUE — CLDNN collapses to chance (0.0909)~~ RESOLVED** (see the top "Fixed — CLDNN
  chance-collapse" entry): root-caused to a CLDNN input-conditioning fragility (tiny raw IQ + no
  input normalization into the 3-LSTM stack collapses for some init draws) and fixed with per-sample
  unit-variance input normalization inside `cldnn.py`. CLDNN re-trained from scratch under the same
  final recipe now scores **0.5805** (paper-faithful 3-LSTM+skip arch; the prior 0.5876 board figure
  was a superseded 2-LSTM/no-skip architecture). MCLDNN/ResNet unchanged.

### Added — Downstream-task prioritization mined from the FM bibliography

- `docs/DOWNSTREAM_TASKS.md`: mined the 9 foundation-model papers in `docs/BIBLIOGRAPHY.md` for the
  downstream tasks each one actually evaluates, normalized synonyms into a canonical taxonomy, and
  bucketed by FM coverage — **P1** (>= 2 FM papers): `amc`, `beam_prediction`, `sei`,
  `direction_finding`, `los_nlos`, `positioning`, `har`; **P2** (1 paper): `interference_id`,
  `protocol_tech_id`, `channel_estimation`, `snr_mobility_recognition`, `wideband_detection`;
  **P3** (defined benchmark track, 0 FM papers): `spectrum_sensing`. Each task carries its FM
  evaluators + datasets/metrics, current rfbench status, a recommended canonical dataset/protocol/
  metric, and scope-fit (IQ-signal vs a proposed separate CSI/6G-sensing track).

### Fixed — CLDNN training divergence (gradient clipping)

- The 150-epoch retrain collapsed CLDNN to chance (0.0909): its 3 stacked LSTMs explode at lr=1e-3
  over the longer schedule (the new recipe holds the LR higher for longer), and `argmax(NaN)`
  predicts a constant class. Added a global gradient-norm cap (`DEFAULT_GRAD_CLIP=5.0`, applied in
  `_train_one_epoch`) that stabilises the recurrent baselines without biting the CNN baselines, plus
  a NaN-loss guard that logs an ERROR and stops early, keeping the best checkpoint. MCLDNN/ResNet are
  unaffected (clip does not trigger for them). Baselines to be re-trained under the final recipe.

### Changed — AMC baseline paper-conformance + training-recipe fix (M3)

- **Regression root-caused** (4-way audit + adversarial verification): the `training.py` rewrite selected
  the best checkpoint on **validation loss**, whose minimum precedes the accuracy peak on RadioML, so it
  restored a suboptimal checkpoint and dragged every baseline down (CLDNN −8 pt). `train_baseline()` now
  selects/restores the best checkpoint on **validation accuracy** (same argmax/label convention as
  `core.evaluate`), keeps `ReduceLROnPlateau` on val loss, and early-stops on accuracy. Recipe loosened:
  patience 20→40, `min_delta` 1e-4→0, `lr_patience` 5→10, `min_lr` 1e-6→1e-7.
- **MCLDNN fusion made paper-exact**: element-wise add → channel-axis **concatenate** (`conv_fuse`
  in-channels 50→100, VALID padding → post-fusion length 124), matching the official `wzjialang/MCLDNN`.
- **ResNet depth adapted to the len-128 window**: `num_stacks` 6→3 (6 MaxPools over-pool 128→2; L=3 keeps
  the paper's ~16 final time steps, `flat_dim` 64→512), `alpha_dropout` 0.5→0.3.
- CLDNN left unchanged to isolate the recipe fix. Tests updated; suite green. Baselines to be re-trained
  from scratch (seed 42, 150 epochs) on the cluster to refresh the board.

### Changed — Leaderboard site redesign (generic, per-metric)

- **WP-50 rewrite.** `leaderboard/site/generate.py` is now fully data-driven: it renders **every** task
  (not just AMC), one `<task>.html` per task with results, and a **column or plot for every metric** —
  one table column per scalar metric (primary pinned first) and one inline `<svg>` line plot per curve
  metric (e.g. `accuracy_vs_snr`). Self-contained dark/light CSS, family chips, and
  `verified`/`self_reported` badges.
- **Protocol invariants enforced in markup.** One `<table data-regime data-track>` per distinct
  `(regime, track)` pair — two regimes never share a table, and same-regime different-track results split
  into separate tables. Rows sorted by the primary metric descending.
- `tests/test_site.py` rewritten (16 tests, mutation-checked non-trivial) against the new generic output;
  full suite green (342 passed, 29 skipped), `ruff`/`black`/`mypy` clean.

### Added — Real dataset loaders (M1, no generation)

Per the "use the datasets from the reference papers, do not generate" decision:

- **AMC.** RadioML 2016.10a (pickle, `opendata.deepsig.io`) + 2018.01a (HDF5) real loaders; **Sig53 is a
  reported blocker** (generation-only, no static release — not synthesised).
- **SEI.** Real loaders for WiSig (ManyTx), ORACLE (SigMF), LoRa RFFI (HDF5), each targeting the confirmed
  official source; credential-gated sources raise with manual-download instructions (no scraping).
- **Detection.** Adopted **RadDet** (ICASSP 2025, real published spectrogram + YOLO box annotations) as the
  wideband-detection dataset; **WBSig53 is a blocker** (generation-only). Protocol + task layer updated.
- Heavy deps (numpy/h5py/requests) stay lazy behind `rfbench[data]`; parsers tested on synthetic fixtures
  (real stdlib-pickle fixture for RadioML 2016; `importorskip` for HDF5). CLI wired to the real API.

### Added — Submission, publish, verify, FM wrappers (M5/M6)

- **WP-51/52 — Submission & publish CI.** `.github/workflows/validate-submission.yml`
  (`rfbench submit --check` + no-raw-data guard on PRs touching `leaderboard/results/**`) and
  `build-leaderboard.yml` (build the site → deploy to GitHub Pages on push to main); issue-form
  templates for submissions and task proposals.
- **WP-53 — Verification pipeline.** `rfbench/verify.py` + `rfbench verify`: checks manifest
  completeness and re-run metrics within tolerance, flips `verification.status → verified` with
  `verified_by/at/hardware`; `submit --check` strengthened to validate the submission manifest.
- **WP-60/61 — Foundation-model wrappers.** `rfbench/models/foundation/` generic wrapper (Model +
  `embed()`), a dependency-free example FM running in all four regimes via `evaluate()`, a copy-me
  template, and `docs/ADDING_A_MODEL.md`.
- **WP-50 fix — Leaderboard by track.** The board now separates by (task, track) as well as regime,
  so SEI (closed_set/cross_receiver/cross_day) and detection (detection/recognition) tracks are
  reported in separate tables.
- **Cluster recon.** `slurm/probe_torchsig*.sh`: `.[detection]` installs on aarch64 (torch 2.12+cu130,
  torchsig 2.1.1); torchsig 2.x replaced named WBSig53 with a config-driven wideband API — informs the
  real detection loader (still a lazy stub, pending a torchsig-1.x-vs-2.x decision).

### Added — Sprint 2 — Task adapters (M2)

- **WP-20 — AMC task.** `rfbench/tasks/amc/`: `AmcTask` (registered `amc`) + metrics
  `accuracy_overall` (primary, full SNR range), `accuracy_vs_snr` curve, `macro_f1` (pure-stdlib),
  dataset adapter, `configs/task/amc.yaml`.
- **WP-21 — SEI task.** `rfbench/tasks/sei/`: `SeiTask` (registered `sei`), tracks
  closed_set/cross_receiver/cross_day/open_set; `rank1_accuracy` (primary) + `auroc`/`eer` as
  separate metrics (pure-stdlib), `configs/task/sei.yaml`.
- **WP-22 — Wideband detection task.** `rfbench/tasks/wideband_detection/`: task + `mAP`/`mAR`/`IoU`
  (pure-stdlib IoU+AP path, lazy torchmetrics for production), detection vs recognition tracks kept
  distinct, `configs/task/wideband_detection.yaml`.
- **Cluster.** `slurm/setup_and_test_arm.sh`: CPU-only job that builds the `rfbench` venv on an ARM
  compute node and runs the full suite on aarch64 (proves the harness on the target arch).

### Added — Sprint 1 wave 2 — Data layer, leaderboard, CLI (M1/M2/M5, scaffolds)

Datasets are not redistributed and real `prepare` runs on the cluster (ARM venv, `rfbench[data]` /
`rfbench[detection]`); heavy deps are imported lazily and unit tests exercise the split path on
pure-stdlib synthetic fixtures.

- **WP-11 — AMC data (template).** `rfbench/data/prepare/{_common,amc}.py` + `download/amc_*.py`:
  RadioML → 80/10/10 stratified by (modulation × SNR); Sig53 → adopted official TorchSig split.
  `_common.py` (cache dir via `$RFBENCH_CACHE`, split+manifest helpers) is reused by SEI/detection.
- **WP-12 — SEI data.** `rfbench/data/prepare/sei.py` + `download/sei_*.py`: `closed_set`,
  `cross_receiver`, `cross_day` generated as separate grouped conditions with disjoint rx/day groups.
- **WP-13 — Detection data.** `rfbench/data/prepare/detection.py` + `download/detection_wbsig53.py`:
  split per policy + a T-F box annotations sidecar; detection vs recognition tracks kept distinct.
- **WP-50 — Leaderboard site.** `leaderboard/site/generate.py` (`build_site`): static HTML from
  `results/**.json`, sorted by primary metric, one table per regime (never mixed), verified/self_reported
  badges; seeded with sample result JSONs under `leaderboard/results/`.
- **WP-42 — CLI wiring.** `rfbench data prepare` / `eval` / `submit --check` / `leaderboard build` wired
  to the real implementations; heavy imports stay lazy so `import rfbench` and `rfbench --help` remain
  dependency-free.

### Added — Sprint 1 wave 1 — Splits & eval harness (M1/M4, partial)

- **Split policy (normative).** `docs/EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md`: adopt an official/literature split when
  one exists (provenance recorded), otherwise a deterministic **80/10/10** stratified split, seed 42.
  Ratios + seed are part of `canonical_split_id`; this supersedes the earlier 60/20/20 AMC placeholder.
- **WP-10 — Deterministic splits.** `rfbench/core/splits.py`: `make_split` (pure-stdlib, seeded,
  stratified, default 80/10/10) → `SplitManifest`; `adopt_official_split` (pass-through), reproducible
  `write_split_index` + `split_checksum`. No generated indices committed (no data yet).
- **WP-40 — `evaluate()` + `result.json`.** `rfbench/core/evaluate.py`: the single canonical emitter;
  assembles a schema-valid `result.json` (regime declared verbatim, `verification.status=self_reported`),
  validated against `schemas/result.schema.json` via lazily-imported `jsonschema`.
- **WP-41 — Regime adapters.** `rfbench/regimes/` (`from_scratch`, `full_finetune`, `linear_probe`
  with a pure-Python nearest-centroid head, `few_shot(k)`) + `configs/config.yaml` and
  `configs/regime/*.yaml`. Dependency-free; real numerical heads deferred to M3/M6 behind extras.

### Added — Sprint 0 — Bootstrap & contracts (M0)

Scaffolds the repo, freezes the core contracts and JSON schemas, and lands the normative docs and
CI skeleton.

- **WP-00 — Repo & packaging.** `pyproject.toml` defining the `rfbench` package (at repo root,
  not `src/`) and the `rfbench` CLI entrypoint; pre-commit with `ruff` + `black` (line-length 100);
  Apache-2.0 `LICENSE`.
- **WP-01 — JSON schemas.** Frozen `schemas/result.schema.json` (one evaluation run = one
  leaderboard row; regime always declared; `verification.status` ∈ `{self_reported, verified}`)
  and `schemas/submission.schema.json` (reproducibility manifest), with valid/invalid examples
  under `schemas/examples/`.
- **WP-02 — Core contracts (ABCs).** `rfbench/core/{task,dataset,metric,model,registry,splits,`
  `evaluate,manifest}.py`: typed interfaces with docstrings and minimal bodies; ABCs are not
  instantiable.
- **WP-03 — Normative docs.** `docs/EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md`, `docs/SUBMISSION.md`,
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, plus `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Each task has a defined
  metric + split + regimes; the two-tier submission workflow is described end to end.
- **WP-04 — CI skeleton.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running lint, unit tests, and schema checks.

### Notes

- **No raw data in git** (D3): only split indices + checksums are versioned under
  `leaderboard/splits/`; datasets are fetched via `rfbench data prepare` and honour `$RFBENCH_CACHE`.
- **Frozen contracts:** the core ABCs and JSON schemas are locked at Sprint 0; changing them
  requires an explicit review and a version bump.
- Scope is terrestrial RF only (D1); satellite RF is a separate repository.
